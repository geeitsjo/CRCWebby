			<h2> Who We Are </h2>
				<p> Wellington CRC, formerly the Christian Revival Centre, has been in Wellington for over sixty years. It has a stable history going right back to the roots of the Pentecostal movement, even as far back as 1926 when Smith Wigglesworth first came to New Zealand and the Pentecostal full gospel message was preached.
				Our church consists of a broad range of cultures and age groups and reflects the changing nature of New Zealand culture and community. We enjoy a healthy growing church made up of passionate and committed people making up this vibrant community.</p>

				<p>We are a Pentecostal church in the heart of Wellington New Zealand. We celebrate Communion weekly and encourage people to not only participate in church services but also to connect with people and build friendship and relationship on an ongoing and long term basis.</p>

				<p>Our focus is to become <q>by grace what Christ is by nature</q>. This means we are always encouraging people to grow and become a mature disciple of Jesus Christ. A lifelong journey for everyone. </p>
